SAMPLE_PROTOCOL: >
  SDPC lipid films were prepared from chloroform stock solutions and dried
  under Ar gas with gentle heating, followed by vacuum drying for at least 4 h.
  Samples were hydrated with ultrapure H2O or D2O using repeated freeze–thaw cycles.
  Vesicles were extruded through 50 nm polycarbonate membranes to form ULVs.
  Final lipid concentration was approximately 12 mg/ml.
  All handling was performed under an Ar atmosphere to limit lipid oxidation.
