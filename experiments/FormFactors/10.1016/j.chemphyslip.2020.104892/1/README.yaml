SAMPLE_PROTOCOL: >
  PDPC films were prepared from chloroform stock solutions, dried under Ar gas
  with gentle heating and further dried in vacuo for at least 4 h.
  Samples were hydrated using freeze–thaw–vortex cycles with ultrapure H2O.
  Vesicles were extruded through 50 nm polycarbonate filters to produce ULVs.
  Lipid concentration was approximately 12 mg/ml.
  All preparations were performed under an Ar atmosphere (O2 < 2%) to minimize oxidation.
