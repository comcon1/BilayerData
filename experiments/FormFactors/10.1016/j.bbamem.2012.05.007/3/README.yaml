SAMPLE_PROTOCOL: > 
  Up to 60 mg of lipid was mixed with 1.5 ml 0.1 M NaCl and temperature cycled
  through the main phase transition until a uniform MLV dispersion was obtained.
  MLVs were then extruded through 500-Å polycarbonate filters. SUVs were diluted
  to a final lipid concentration of ~20 mg/ml.
