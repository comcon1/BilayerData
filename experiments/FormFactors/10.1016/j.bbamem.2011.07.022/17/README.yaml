SAMPLE_PROTOCOL: >
  Up to 60 mg of lipid was mixed with 1.5 ml MilliQ water and temperature cycled through
  the main phase transition until a uniform MLV dispersion was obtained. MLVs were then
  extruded through 500-Å polycarbonate filters. SUVs were diluted to a final lipid concentration
  of ~20 mg/ml.
