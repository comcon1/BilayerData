  4 mg of chloroform/methanol (2:1) dissolved SOPC was dried on a silicon wafer, and
  a stack of membranes was prepared using an established protocol (S. Tristram-Nagle,
  in Methods in Molecular Biology, edited by A. M. Dopico (Humana Press, Totowa, NJ, 2007),
  Vol. 400, p. 63.). The stack composed of ~2000 membranes.
