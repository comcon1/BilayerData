SAMPLE_PROTOCOL: >
  TOCL/Na+ (30.0mg, 1.0 eq.) was dissolved with 10ml chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) in a 50ml pear
  shaped flask and the solvent was slowly evaporated under reduced pressure (250mbar, 40°C) to
  yield liposomes. A solution of Na2B4O17H20 (7.6mg, 1.0eq.) and BOH3 (4.9mg, 4.0eq.) in 5ml de-
  gassed water was prepared and added to the flask. Formed white flakes disapeared after rotating the
  flask at 800mbar for one minute. The Folch method was performed and 20ml chloroform:methanol
  (2:1, v/v) were added to the aqueous phase. An emulsion formed after shaking the mixture, a ho-
  mogeneous and clear solution formed after adding 3.3ml methanol. A phase separation occurred
  and the lower phase was dried under a constant stream of argon at 40°C over night. The predried
  sample was freeze-dried over night, 20.0µl degassed water was added and the Eppendorf was stored
  at 50°C for one day. Lost water was added and the sample was mixed thoroughly with a steel rod.
  After another day of equilibration the sample was again mixed before packing the insert.
