SAMPLE_PROTOCOL: >
  TMCL/NH4+ (26.2mg, 1.0 eq.), n-Octyl β-D-thioglucopyranoside (BOG, 6mg, 1.0eq.),
  DSS (0.25mg, 0.06eq.) and TMAOHx5H2O (7.4mg, 2.0eq.) were dissolved with 1ml
  chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) in an eppendorf vial. The solvent was evaporated at 40°C under
  a constant stream of argon and the predried sample was freeze-dried over night. 20.5µl degassed
  water was added and the Eppendorf was stored at 40°C for two days. Lost water was added and the
  sample was mixed thoroughly with a steel rod. After another two days of equilibration the sample
  was again mixed before packing the insert.
  Hydration by 1H MAS NMR: 13 per tail,
  TMA+ concentration determined by 1H NMR. Na+ concentration guessed.
