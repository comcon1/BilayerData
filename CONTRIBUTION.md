Please read the corresponding parts of the document before you start contributing.

## Contributing to the database: simulations, experiments, and molecules

_Adding_ new data is described in detail in [the FAIRMD Lipids
documentation](https://databank.readthedocs.io/stable/dbcontribute.html).
Please follow the instructions carefully for both simulations and experiments,
filling metadata fields with meaningful and complete information. You can add
simulations through the [automatic addition
portal](https://upload-portal.nmrlipids.fi) only if all molecules and their naming
conventions are already in the databank.

When you find mistakes in the data, please inform the community by opening [an
issue](https://github.com/NMRLipids/BilayerData/issues/new?template=bug_data.yml)
or open a pull-request if you want to fix it by yourself.

_Deleting_ data is possible and very welcome _iff_ you can prove that the
data is problematic. It is applicable first of all for the experiments because
incorrect experiments affect the quality. Incorrect simulations will just get
very bad quality; however, if there is a mistaken simulation, duplicated
trajectory, or fraud, it can also be deleted.

**Labels** 

*For project members:* please apply one of our dedicated labels for opening issues or marking your PR:

- `contribution:mol`
- `contribution:exp`
- `contribution:sim`
- `bug:data` if a mistake was found

If you see an unlabeled issue or a PR created by an external contributor, please suggest applying a right label if it fits the scope.

## Repository rules

1. Anyone can contribute. You do not need to open an issue before submitting a pull request.

2. We require at least one review from an organization member to accept a
   pull-request.

3. Please keep the main branch in your fork updated so that it can be rebased (we
   prefer rebasing over merging).

4. Once you address an issue, please refer to it in the PR description (and in the commit message)
   by using phrases like 'Partially fixes #000'.

5. We recommend contributors squash commits if there is no use in storing history.

5. Check representation of yourself in `AUTHORS.md` and `CITATION.cff` files.

6. Everyone is always welcome to participate in repository discussions and
   NMRlipids community events to develop data and code together.

## Database self-maintenance

BilayerData is an on-GitHub database, and it has a set of workflows to perform
its own maintenance.

**Self-checks** are run every time a contributor adds a commit to a pull request.
Please do not ignore them. Their output can guide you on how to improve your
metadata or point to errors.

**Metadata enrichment** workflows run on changed `README.yaml` files and post their
findings as inline review suggestions on the pull request. Contributors of simulations
and experiments, as well as curators, should review these suggestions and accept or
reject them deliberately: they are automatically derived (e.g. from publication or dataset
records via their DOI), so they complement but do not replace the metadata you provide yourself.

**Simulation ID uniqueness** is maintained by auto-PRs. Each simulation is
added with a negative ID, and then it adds a PR to fix it. It ensures uniqueness of
IDs.

**Quality recomputations** are also performed with auto-PRs. If one is
contributing to experiments or simulations, it's not required to run matching
or quality evaluation - it will be run by our self-maintenance system automatically.
However, if your changes break further analysis, it's good to know about it, so we
recommend running a quality evaluation locally to check that it works.

_Security notes:_ AutoPRs cannot be triggered by external contributors because they
are triggered by merging. Merging a PR, in turn, requires the approval of an organization member,
so auto-PRs cannot be triggered silently.

## Versioning policy and releases

BilayerData is a developing database. It has a lot of various manifest files that can
change their schemas at some point. We have a semantic version system `vX.Y.Z` where `X` is
a major version, `Y` is called a minor version, and `Z` is a patch. We increase:

- the patch `Z` when we decide that the contribution to the database is significant since the previous patch
- minor version `Y` when some schemas were changed
- major version `X` when the project reaches the next large milestone

Changes in workflow and documentation don't increase the version. 

_NOTE_ that the version of BilayerData is independent of the version of the Python
package [FAIRMD_lipids](https://github.com/NMRlipids/FAIRMD_lipids). However,
if some algorithm is changed in the package, for example, quality evaluation,
it will automatically mean that the quality over the whole databank is recomputed
and we should increase the minor version here.

Versions are released so we can cite the release of the database from external documents, which is
simpler than citing commit hashes.

Automatically formed release notes are acceptable if there is no additional
context we should add. If the version increase happens because of the package's
algorithm change, we must write it explicitly.

# Integration with the website

The web portal [lipids.fairmd.org](https://lipids.fairmd.org) is continuously
deployed from both [its own source
repository](https://github.com/NMRlipids/BilayerGUI_laravel) to update
backend/frontend code and from this repository to update records. System
should appear on the website a few minutes after it is accepted to the `main`
branch.
